# Open-Source Delta Robot for High-Speed Metal Sorting

This repository contains the complete open-source hardware and software
resources for a delta robot system designed for high-speed sorting of
metallic objects in industrial environments.

The platform integrates a parallel kinematic delta robot, a conveyor-based
material handling system, vision-based object detection, and a magnetic
end-effector for rapid pick-and-place operations.

## Repository Structure

- CAD/: Mechanical design files (SolidWorks)
- BOM/: Bill of Materials with cost estimates
- Software/: Control and vision processing scripts
- Simulation/: MATLAB Simscape model
- Docs/: Assembly and operation documentation

## Hardware Specifications

- Degrees of freedom: 3 (translational)
- Payload capacity: up to 3 kg
- Repeatability: ±0.02 mm
- Sorting speed: up to 120 picks per minute

## Reproducibility

All files required to reproduce the system are provided. The platform is
intended for research, education, and industrial prototyping.
